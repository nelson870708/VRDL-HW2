# VRDL-HW2
NCTU Selected Topics in Visual Recognition using Deep Learning Homework 2

## Hardware
The following specs were used to create the original solution.
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40 GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X

## Installation
1. Using Anaconda is strongly recommended. {envs_name} is the new environment name which you should assign.
    ```
    conda create -n {envs_name} python=3.7
    conda activate {envs_name}
    ```
2. Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), e.g.,
    ```
    conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
    ```
    Note: Make sure that your compilation CUDA version and runtime CUDA version match.
    You can check the supported CUDA version for precompiled packages on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

    `E.g.1` If you have CUDA 10.1 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install
    PyTorch 1.5, you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 10.1.

    ```
    conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch
    ```

    `E.g. 2` If you have CUDA 9.2 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install
    PyTorch 1.3.1., you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 9.2.

    ```shell
    conda install pytorch=1.3.1 cudatoolkit=9.2 torchvision=0.4.2 -c pytorch
    ```

    If you build PyTorch from source instead of installing the prebuilt pacakge,
    you can use more CUDA versions such as 9.0.
